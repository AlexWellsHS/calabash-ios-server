 Q:  How do I programmatically quit my iOS application?

 A: There is no API provided for gracefully terminating an iOS application.

 In iOS, the user presses the Home button to close applications. Should your
 application have conditions in which it cannot provide its intended function,
 the recommended approach is to display an alert for the user that indicates the
 nature of the problem and possible actions the user could take â€” turning on
 WiFi, enabling Location Services, etc. Allow the user to terminate the
 application at their own discretion.

 Warning: Do not call the exit function. Applications calling exit will appear
 to the user to have crashed, rather than performing a graceful termination and
 animating back to the Home screen.

 Additionally, data may not be saved, because -applicationWillTerminate: and
 similar UIApplicationDelegate methods will not be invoked if you call exit.

 If during development or testing it is necessary to terminate your application,
 the abort function, or assert macro is recommended.

 $ xcrun man abort
 The abort() function causes a report to be generated by Crash Reporter.  If you
  wish to terminate without generating a crash
 report, use exit(3) instead.

 Is it me or do the docs contradict each other?

 exit(3) => "exited abnormally with exit status 3"
 exit(0) => < no output >
*/
}
